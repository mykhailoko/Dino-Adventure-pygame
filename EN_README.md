# Dino Adventure

Welcome to the Dino Adventure game! This project is a recreation of the classic browser game you might encounter when your internet connection goes down and you see a dinosaur on the "No Internet Connection" page in Google Chrome. Our version of the game offers many unique features and functions that you will not find in the classic version from Google. The project was created in Python using the Pygame library.

# How to play
* Jump: Press Spacebar, Up Arrow key or W key on your keyboard to make the dinosaur jump over obstacles.  
* Dodge: Press the down arrow key or S key to make the dinosaur go under obstacles.  
* Score: Your score increases as you successfully avoid obstacles. 

# Peculiarities
* Adaptability: The game adapts to different screen sizes, allowing you to play on desktop computers or mobile devices.  
* Endless gameplay: The game continues endlessly, challenging you to achieve the highest score possible.
* Levels: Completing levels adds new challenges and opportunities, keeping the game interesting and varied.  
* Skins: Personalize your dinosaur with a variety of skins, allowing you to stand out from other players.  
* Boosts: Use boosts to gain temporary benefits such as a slow or temporary invulnerability, which adds a strategic element to the game. 
* Multiplayer: Ability to compete with friends in cooperative mode or in real time.
